negative,0,81,"I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software.",This product is real bad from amazon. Although i dont expect much from a cheap tablet however this was even below my expectations. Its way slow to respond to anything or everything. My 3 year old goes after my ipad when i give him this....wont recommend to anyone.,"I had an old ipad and when it quit I decided to go for the amazon fire tablet--really only used it to play games and for entertainment....i hate it---battery life is very short I pretty much need to keep it plugged in at all times, and it freezes and just shuts out of screens. I can't take it anymore and am now going to buy another ipad---don't waste your money on this!! I am very unimpressed with this product and amazon in general now."
negative,1,5,"Super slow, not of decent quality.I would not buy another. Memory on it is lacking for 8 gig. I will not recommend it to anyone",Barely 4k content and it lags a lot. Not worth it. Returned!,Even after reading the reviews about it being slow I decided to go head any purchase it. Didn't thick it was going to be this slow
neutral,0,92,"This was a good tablet. I bought it for my Gf who basically only wanted it for Netflix and YouTube. The display was good, not great. The issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. This could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one.","This is a good tablet for the price, however, it runs slow and the touch screen response is not the best. This isn't the right tablet if you're looking for a high speed, high performance tablet.","Bought this for my nephew. The price is right, however, the tablet is terrible. Spend the money and get an iPad."
neutral,1,8,"I have to say Alexa has been a great disappointment. Most of the time she doesn't know the answer to anything and tells us that she doesn't understand the question. I thought this thing was supposed to get smarter as it goes along. We had to sign up for AMAZON Prime and Unlimited Music just to actually listen to decent music. When she does know a command for example like say ""Loop Mode"" when you want her to repeat a song... most of the time she understands that. And then there are a lot of times when she simply beeps out or even says she doesn't understand the question no matter how many times you say it. We use her mostly for a timer, alarm, play music and for 6 questions of Jeopardy a day. Really needs a lot of improvement. Ask her what a dog says.. she says bow wow or woof. *Sigh* If she can only be basic on that answer, there isn't much more she is gonna get right. There are also a lot of pretty useless skills for her available. We got it at a discounted price thankfully and I also got a Dot for in the bedroom at a cheaper price. Dot is even worse at listening to commands than Echo is.","Bestbuy came through before the holiday better than Amazon--item available, arrived within 2 days, competitively priced. Great service there. My problem is with disappointing performance by Echo. Siri wins over Alexa. Issues encountered:1) a skill will be installed, but Alexa will tell me first, I need to install the skill and second, that the skill is already installed. User is stuck in a do-loop with no response.2) access to quick 1-sentence read from Wikipedia is appreciated, but if you ask 'tell me more,' Alexa's voice is so rushed and computerized, some of the information is unintelligible.3) tons of skills, but so many of them are at a micro level and others are 1-time gimmicks. If you are not careful, you then need a skill to help you with all the skills you've installed.4) responses on some of the more interesting skills are just plain wrong. Vocabulary on word master is limited, so you will told your response is not a word that begins with ""X"" and we have had instances where our correct response on Jeopardy is reported as not correct. In one skill about a magic door (?) a clue is described, but when selected, you are sent backward a step with the same clue offered again. Frustrating and makes you feel you are doing something wrong or not speaking clearly. Children can get frustrated quickly.5) access to music is quirky. Some pieces by classical composers will play only a few minutes of a selection, abruptly stop and begin a new piece. But some singers and ambient pieces will play for hours.Positives: flash briefing, weather, word definitions, Pandora access timer.","My review is not a review of the device as much as my opinion on which product to choose when trying to decide between this and Google home.Google home is the closest competition in this landscape and its still lacking in comparison to Alexa.All of the interesting features of Google home are non existent or slowly being released. Using these features as a selling point is disingenuous.More than that Google home constantly has trouble detecting my voice and doing any of the assistant commands. In the same environment the echo dot with budget hardware had better success rate. When it did detect it the time to action was x2 as long as Google home is much more ""chatty""."
positive,4,988,This is a really great tablet me and my kids love it.,"this is a great tablet for the price. my kid loves it ,does alot reading on it.","This tablet is a great buy. It does many things and keeps my kids happy. I'm very pleased, we have 2 of them."
positive,3,349,The Echo is a great device to have around the house. Ask questions & Alexa answers.,"I bought this Echo because of the price ,its fun! i like the stereo component the most but I also play with Alexa often,,,,still learning how to submit the skills, most of which you need to interact with Alexa.",Love my (Alexa) amazon echo. Would highly recommend.
positive,2,113,"The Amazon fire Tv is an all around great product for a great price. It is a little more expensive compared to the Fire stick but it is well worth the price difference. The Fire Tv offers 4k compability and also seems to be a little faster. It allows me to watch all my paid subscription it one place such as Netflix, Hulu and even amazon prime without have to use my PS4. All in all I would recommend this product to anyone who has paid subscription it works well with them and let you view them all in one place.",I like the flexibility and great responsiveness of the FireTV. Our family is able take advantage of the built in options (including Amazon Prime) and set it up just the way I like. I also have friends who prefer the Fire Stick. They have customized those and still have good performance. FireTV is great for anyone and even better if you are a little tech savvy..,The amazon fire tv is great in all aspects and is so fast
