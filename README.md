# Automated Customer Reviews

This project builds an NLP pipeline that turns raw product reviews into practical insights.

It covers three core capabilities:
1) **Sentiment classification** — label reviews as **negative / neutral / positive**
2) **Theme clustering** — group reviews into **themes**, then roll them up into **4–6 meta-categories**
3) **Recommendation writeups** — generate short “recommendation-style” summaries per meta-category

## Project structure

- `notebooks/` — experiments + results (preprocessing, modeling, clustering, writeups)
- `data/raw/` — original dataset (ignored by git)
- `data/processed/` — cleaned train/test splits + labeled test set (ignored by git)
- `src/` — reusable Python modules (optional for later refactor)
- `app/` — deployment app (planned / in progress)
- `reports/` — artifacts + figures generated by the notebooks
- `slides/` — presentation assets

## How to run

### 1) Create and activate a virtual environment

    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

### 2) Install dependencies

Recommended (clean install for most machines):

    pip install -r requirements_min.txt

Optional (exact dev environment snapshot, may be GPU/CUDA-specific):

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3) Run notebooks in order

#### Notebook 1 — Preprocessing
`notebooks/01_preprocessing.ipynb`

Outputs:
- `data/processed/train.csv`
- `data/processed/test.csv`

#### Notebook 2 — Classification
`notebooks/02_classification.ipynb`

Models:
- TF-IDF + Logistic Regression (baseline)
- DistilBERT (transformer classifier)

Outputs:
- `data/processed/test_labeled.csv`
- `reports/artifacts/baseline_classification_report.txt`
- `reports/artifacts/distilbert_metrics.txt`
- confusion matrix images in `reports/artifacts/`

#### Notebook 3 — Clustering + Themes
`notebooks/03_clustering_summarization.ipynb`

Methods:
- Sentence embeddings (MiniLM)
- UMAP (visualization)
- HDBSCAN (clustering)

Outputs:
- `reports/artifacts/theme_dashboard_with_meta.csv`
- `reports/figures/umap_clusters.png`

#### Notebook 4 — Recommendation Articles
`notebooks/04_recommendation_articles.ipynb`

Outputs:
- `reports/artifacts/recommendation_articles.md`
- `reports/artifacts/recommendation_articles.json` (optional)

## Notes / common issues

### Widget render warnings in VS Code
If you see red output like `application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json`, it’s a VS Code/Jupyter display issue after switching notebooks.
It doesn’t affect results.
